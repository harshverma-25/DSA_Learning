## üìå What is Data Structure?

A **data structure** is a method to store, organize, and manage data efficiently in memory so that it can be accessed and modified easily.

> Think of it like organizing books in a library: better organization = faster access.

## üéØ Why Learn Data Structures?

- Efficient storage and processing of data
- Optimized performance
- Essential for coding interviews & placements
- Builds logical and problem-solving skills
- Helps design scalable systems

## üß© Types of Data Structures

### ‚úÖ 1. Primitive Data Structures
- Built-in types like `int`, `char`, `float`, `bool`

### ‚úÖ 2. Non-Primitive Data Structures

#### üß∫ Linear Data Structures
| Structure      | Description                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Array          | Fixed-size elements of the same type     |
| Linked List    | Elements connected via pointers          |
| Stack          | Follows LIFO (Last In First Out)         |
| Queue          | Follows FIFO (First In First Out)        |

#### üå≥ Non-Linear Data Structures
| Structure | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Tree      | Hierarchical structure (like folders in a system)|
| Graph     | Nodes connected by edges (like social networks)  |

#### üîë Other Structures
| Structure    | Use Case                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| HashMap      | Store key-value pairs (fast search)    |
| Heap         | For priority-based tasks               |
| Trie         | Efficient word & prefix searching      |

## üîÅ Common Operations

| Operation   | Purpose                    |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Insertion   | Add new element            |
| Deletion    | Remove an element          |
| Searching   | Find a specific element    |
| Traversal   | Visit each element         |
| Update      | Change an existing value   |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Time & Space Complexity

Each data structure has performance characteristics:
- Array Search = O(n)
- HashMap Search = O(1)

Choosing the right one helps improve speed and memory usage.

## üß† How to Choose the Right Data Structure?

| Need                        | Use                |
|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Fast searching             | HashMap            |
| Maintaining order          | Array / List       |
| Back/Undo functionality    | Stack              |
| Queue system               | Queue              |
| Hierarchical data          | Tree               |
| Connected elements         | Graph              |

## üåç Real-World Examples

| Application          | Data Structure Used |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Browser History       | Stack               |
| Call Queue            | Queue               |
| Folder Structure      | Tree                |
| Google Maps           | Graph               |
| Auto-suggestions      | Trie                |

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Data Structures are key to organizing data efficiently.
- They are the backbone of all complex programs and real-world systems.
- Knowing which structure to use = faster, cleaner code.
